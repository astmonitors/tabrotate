# tabrotate

Tabrotate is a Chrome extension that will create tabs and rotate through them based on a JSON configuration file.

The tabrotate settings allow for the configuration file to be served from a remote host (i.e., a file in a github repository).

This repository is for storing tabrotate JSON configuration files.
